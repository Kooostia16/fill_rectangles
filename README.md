# fill_rectangles
Algorithm to fill empty space with rectangles, given initial set of rectangles

Current implementation lacks some optimizations, but with larger grid sizes it should work fast

I've implemented it mostly just for my wip game with procedural levels

White space in the following images are the rectangles from input set

Grid size in all images is 500x500

![With grid block size 50x50](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0dda50d-9d7e-4bff-854c-8f7c7915050c)

As one can see, with larger grid block size, algorithm skips some space
